## Project Description
This repository hosts a weather forecast application developed using HTML5, CSS3, and React framework. The application leverages real-time data to provide users with accurate weather information, including the current temperature with wind and humidity details, as well as the maximum and minimum temperatures for the day. Additionally, it offers a five-day forecast, displaying the maximum and minimum temperatures for the upcoming days.

## Features
‚Åò Real-time Data: The application fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeather API to fetch up-to-date weather information. <br>
‚Åò Daily Forecast: The application provides the maximum and minimum temperatures for 5 upcoming days. <br>
‚Åò Search Functionality: Users can search for weather information for any desired city worldwide. If multiple cities with the same name exist, users can enter the country code to obtain more accurate results. <br>
